# ublock-origin-list
My personal uBlock origin filter list

This is my best attempt to keep a proper fucking archive of my block list so I can easily sync it between devices.

It's also used with [bypass-paywalls-clean](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bpc-clone/bypass-paywalls-clean-filters/main/bpc-paywall-filter.txt) to not deal with most news sites being dick heads
# How to use
